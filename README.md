**Telegram Goal-Setting Bot with OpenAI Integration**

This Python project creates a Telegram bot that helps users set goals and deadlines. It leverages the python-telegram-bot and openai libraries to provide an interactive experience. Users can:

1. Set goals and deadlines: The bot guides users through setting a goal and choosing a target date for completion.
2. Track progress: While not explicitly implemented in the current code, the framework exists to extend the bot to track progress towards goals and provide reminders.
3. Chat with AI: Users can engage in conversations with an AI powered by OpenAI, adding an element of fun and exploration.
4. Roll dice: A fun feature for a bit of randomness and decision-making support.

Additional Features:
1. Timeout functionality: The bot includes a timeout feature to prevent hanging if users don't respond within a set timeframe.
2. User data recording: User interactions with the bot, including messages and goal information, are logged for potential future analysis or personalization.
